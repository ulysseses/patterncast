Private repository containing the code for the PatternCast Google Sheets Add-On.
This is best used with the [PatternCast service](https://patterncast.com/). Just copy the
PatternCast email into your Google Sheets, Hit "Process Signals", and voila, the P/L stats
show up.

You must have a TDAmeritrade API account, as this Add-On connects to that to scrape the
information.
